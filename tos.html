        <h1>Privacy</h1>
        <p>The website <b>stores a hash of your IP address</b> to set a timer on how often you can post.</p>
        <p>Your IP hash represents an <b>anonymous token</b> used to identify and store posts. Therefore, it is possible to regroup the posted entries under a same person's anonymous identity.</p>
        <p>â€” Bruh what's a hash?<br>A hash is a way to scramble the numbers and letters of an IP address into a random string of characters. It is often used to protect privacy by making the <b>original IP address impossible to trace back</b> or identify.</p>
        <p><b>So in short,</b> no I don't see your IP address.</p>

        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
        <p>By using this website, you agree to the following terms of use:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>By posting a message, you are giving up your rights to delete the submitted content, as the anonymity feature does not allow us to verify who created the post.</li>
            <li>You may say anything, if you want to compliment me, criticise me, my work (or anonymous shitpost if that's what erotically turns you on), just be mindful that a human being is on the other end.</li>
            <li>Please try to use the <b>Category System</b> so that I know what u talkin' about.</li>
            <li>Other than that, nothing much. I value constructive content :)</li>
        </ul>
